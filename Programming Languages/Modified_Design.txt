Modification:
I have created an Array List of Restraunts.
An object for every restarunt is created which stores the price and item for that restraunt.
So one object is created for every restraunt.
Every restraunt have field 
String and float and rest_id
ArrayList of String is created to store values of items in one restraunt
ArrayList of Float is created to store values of price of items in one restraunt.

So Restraunt Looks like 
class restraunt
int rest_id;
ArrayList<String>
ArrayList<float>
